# BCI Real-Time Pipeline

## 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface Real-Time Signal Processing System

This project implements a real-time Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) pipeline for decoding speech-related brain activity, specifically designed for clinical trials and home-based testing of the BrainGate2 system.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The BCI Real-Time Pipeline is designed to:
- **Process EEG signals in real-time** for speech decoding
- **Collect multi-modal data** (EEG, audio, video) from clinical trial participants
- **Provide real-time visualization** of neural activity and decoding results
- **Support home-based testing** for people with neurological disabilities
- **Ensure FDA compliance** for clinical trial data collection

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd BCI-RealTime-Pipeline

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv bci_env
source bci_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: bci_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.bci_pipeline import BCIPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = BCIPipeline()

# Start real-time processing
pipeline.start()

# Process data in real-time
while pipeline.is_running():
    # Get latest decoded results
    speech_intent = pipeline.get_speech_intent()
    
    # Update visualization
    pipeline.update_dashboard()
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Start the BCI pipeline
python src/bci_pipeline.py --mode realtime

# Start with specific configuration
python src/bci_pipeline.py --config config.yaml --mode clinical
```
